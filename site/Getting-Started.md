# For Normal Programmers (Can be done on any computer)
Maybe learn Java first, but you don't need to (we'll try to cover that)

**Download and install** [Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)  
Windowsx86 is 32-bit. Do it if you don't know what bit you have.

**Download a code editor.** Microsoft Word or Notepad won't cut it.  
-[Atom](https://atom.io/)  
-[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)  
-[Brackets](http://brackets.io/)  

**Download the project files.**  
[ftc_app zip file](https://github.com/MiltonStatic5060/ftc_app/archive/master.zip)  
or  
clone our [ftc_app git repo](https://github.com/MiltonStatic5060/ftc_app)  

**You now have the tools to either:**  
[Learn the Java way to program the robot](https://github.com/MiltonStatic5060/5060-tutorials/wiki/Writing-Code#top) (Our Robot Crash Course)  
or

# For Block Programmers (Must be setup at the club first)
(kinda like [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/))

**Get an Android Phone from the club room. (maybe don't buy one just for this)**  Install [this apk application](https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app/releases/download/v3.1_fixed/FtcRobotController-release.apk) on the phone.  

**Get the robot.** you'll need to do [this](https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app/wiki/Configuring-Your-Hardware) at least once to get setup.
