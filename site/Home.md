# Welcome to the 5060-tutorials wiki!
This wiki is a guide to teach the ropes of programming the robot for [FTC Competitions](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc).  

The FTC People say we shall use Android apps and phones to control the robots since the 2016.  We use Java now to program Android. 

This is the [official code](https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app) that they post. They tell us to use [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) to build our Android apps.

We made a copy of the [official code](https://github.com/MiltonStatic5060/ftc_app) (totally legal!) and we have our own simple-ish ways of building our Android apps.

Btw, the original documentation, the javadoc, is available [here](https://miltonstatic5060.github.io/5060-tutorials/index.html) in case you wanted the original stuff.
