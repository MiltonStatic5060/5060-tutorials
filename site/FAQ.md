# Who Runs The Club?

Robot has three parts.   
A body.  
Some motors.  
A brain.  

Bodies and motors can be replaced.  
One does not easily replace a brain.  
This is why programmers are in charge.  

# Which Programming Style Should I Use?

Don't use block programming.  The Block programs can only be used for this one club, only when in the club, and only when one has the robot that stays in the club.  Block programs can't be modified anywhere else, not without a lot of hard work.

Use Java. Java can be anywhere, any computer: Linux, Windows, or Mac.  Java programming can be setup anywhere and can be modified anywhere.  No robot required.  Setup may be a lot of work, but no click and drag means faster writing. Java programs can also be made to span multiple files and super complex robot commands can be made, quickly and easily.

So learn the hard way to program the robot, and don't use the blocks.  Unless you can't handle the hard way then go to your little scratch blocks. (People in the real world don't use blocks)
